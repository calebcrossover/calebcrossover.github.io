                    Caleb Crossover began when Kaleb began getting into FL Studio.
                    He first started out by making simplistic beats, and gradually
                    evolved them to fit his dynamic style as he saw fit.

                    As of 5/7/2024, Caleb Crossover has been a thing for a few months
                    now. That is absolutely amazing, and we want to thank each and
                    every one of you fans, because it wouldn't have been possible without
                    your constant support <3
